# An Introduction to Ordination Methods

## Slides for lectures in the course of ecological methods

This repository contains source files of lecture slides. The slides should be in basic level ("101") and contain little useful for advanced users.

The slides should be processed with `knitr::render()` to produce an
`html` file (see `Makefile`).
